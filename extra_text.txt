Atlantis used to be prosperous. A great kingdom, but a greedy one. One day, Zues and Posieden had enough of them. They banished the kingdom of Atlantis to the bottom of the Earth. The Atlantians survived by inventing a mirror system to have light in their kingdom. But, three thousand years later, the mirrors are starting to cack. The fate of Atlantis rests in your hands.


Yay! You saved Atlantis! Now everyone will survive!
